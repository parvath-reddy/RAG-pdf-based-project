Final-year Computer Science student at VIT specializing in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI innovation. I build intelligent systems that bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and practical business impact—transforming complex data into automated solutions that drive measurable results.

What I Do:
I architect end-to-end AI systems across three core areas:

Generative & Agentic AI – Developed App-Builder AI, a multi-agent platform using LangChain and LangGraph that converts natural language into production-ready applications in under 2 minutes, reducing prototyping time by 70%. Built a RAG-powered Teaching Assistant achieving 85-90% accuracy with local LLMs for privacy-conscious educational support.

Machine Learning & Risk Analytics – Designed ML pipelines for fraud detection (99.7% accuracy) and credit risk prediction that prevent multi-million-dollar losses. Deployed real-time prediction systems using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting via Streamlit.

Data Analytics & Business Intelligence – Delivered actionable insights from complex datasets (2GB+) using SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel. Created interactive dashboards with DAX measures and KPIs that optimize operations, reveal market trends, and support strategic decision-making across sales, supply chain, and financial domains.

Technical Foundation:
Python | Pandas | Scikit-Learn | XGBoost | SQL | Power BI | LLMs | LangChain | LangGraph | RAG | Streamlit | Groq API

Current Focus:
Research internship at Suvidha Foundation on NLP/NLG, drafting publication-ready research while continuing to build autonomous AI systems that don't just predict—they create, adapt, and act independently.

Open to opportunities where data science, generative AI, and strategic thinking converge to solve real-world problems.
